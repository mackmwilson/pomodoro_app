Pomodoro Tkinter Application
=================
This project is a simple GUI application for a Pomodoro Timer.  It tracks your study time and gives you short breaks and then a long break.

It also has functionality to log your study to a text file so you can remember what you studied on what day.


This project is based off Dr. Angela Yu's project in her 100 days of code series on Udemy, with enhancements.
